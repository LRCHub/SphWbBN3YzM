[00:04.40] My days are so busy it's making me dizzy
[00:07.16] There's so much I gotta do
[00:09.79] There's lunches and meetings and poetry readings
[00:11.47] And endless interviews
[00:13.39] Gotta pose for a portrait
[00:15.04] And how I deplore sitting there for eternity
[00:17.60] Then it's off to the inn
[00:19.31] Where my innkeeper friend
[00:20.49] Wants to name a drink after me
[00:22.31] Then it's back to my room, where I resume
[00:24.62] My attempt to write a hit
[00:26.80] Just me and my beer and the terrible fear
[00:28.93] That I might be losing it
[00:30.85] And it's hard,
[00:32.10] It's hard
[00:33.42] It's hard,
[00:34.72] It's hard
[00:34.95] It's really hard
[00:35.92] So very very hard
[00:37.86] It's really hard
[00:38.70] Very very hard
[00:38.99] I make it look easy but honey believe me
[00:40.45] It's hard
[00:41.08] It's hard
[00:41.39] It's hard,
[00:42.35] It's hard
[00:42.35] It's so incredibly hard
[00:44.54] So inconceivably, unbelievably hard
[00:48.94] It's hard to be the bard
[00:53.44] Honestly, I don't know how I do it.
[00:55.48] There's only so much of me to go around.
[00:58.84] I've got so many fans
[01:00.71] With so many demands
[01:02.07] I can hardly go take a piss
[01:03.92] He can't pee
[01:04.32] Be it theater-freak or
[01:05.45] The autograph-seeker
[01:06.37] They all want a piece of this
[01:07.58] Gimme, Gimme
[01:08.50] It's a cross that I bear,
[01:09.58] I'm like Jesus, I swear
[01:10.82] It's a burden but I suffer through it
[01:12.52] He is suffering
[01:13.18] It's all part of the game,
[01:14.29] The trappings of fame
[01:15.20] But somebody's gotta do it
[01:16.50] So he does it
[01:16.97] And I know, I know, I gotta go
[01:19.13] And get back to my pen and ink
[01:21.06] Oh don't make me do it,
[01:22.62] Don't make me go through it
[01:23.75] Can somebody get me a drink!
[01:25.65] 'Cause it's hard
[01:26.58] It's hard
[01:26.97] It's hard,
[01:27.56] It's hard
[01:28.07] It's really really hard
[01:30.16] It's sexy but it's hard
[01:32.42] It's really hard
[01:33.31] Sexy but it's hard
[01:33.55] This bar that I'm
[01:33.94] Raising to be this amazing!
[01:35.08] It's hard,
[01:35.75] It's hard
[01:35.99] It's hard,
[01:36.52] It's hard
[01:36.98] It's so annoyingly hard
[01:38.83] So unavoidably, unenjoyably hard
[01:42.98] It's hard to be the bard, baby
[01:49.15] I know writing made me famous,
[01:50.13] But being famous is just so much more fun.
[01:53.37] You see... What people just don't understand
[01:56.17] Is that writing's demanding
[01:57.25] It's mentally challenging and it's a bore
[01:58.96] It's such a chore
[02:00.46] To sit in a room by yourself
[02:01.95] Oh my god, I just hate it!
[02:03.26] And you're trying to find
[02:05.12] An opening line or a brilliant idea
[02:07.09] And you're pacing the floor
[02:08.23] And hoping for just a bit of divine intervention
[02:11.35] That one little nugget that one little spark
[02:13.64] Then Eureka! You find it you're ready to start
[02:15.78] So now you can write, right? Wrong!
[02:18.53] You're not even close, you remember that damn it,
[02:20.62] Your play's gotta be in iambic pentameter!
[02:22.84] So you write down a word but it's not the right word,
[02:25.30] So you try a new word but you hate the new word
[02:27.98] And you need a good word but you can't find the word
[02:30.07] Oh where is it, what is it, what is it, where is it!
[02:32.02] Blah-blah-blah, ha ha, ah-ha -UGHHHHHHHH!
[02:35.23] Sir.
[02:36.12] Hello.
[02:37.81] You asked for information on what Nicholas Bottom is writing.
[02:40.49] Our spy is here with the news.
[02:41.81] Did he see me losing it?
[02:44.23] He's half blind, sir.
[02:45.77] Oh, good. Then he only saw half of it.
[02:47.05] You see what I did? Ha ha.
[02:49.52] Speak, man. What news?
[02:52.02] I saw Nick Bottom, I did.
[02:53.88] He paid a soothsayer to foresee what Shakespeare's greatest play would be.
[02:57.49] That sneaky little thief!
[02:59.50] Why doesn't he come up with his own ideas!?
[03:02.63] It's hard
[03:03.76] No. It is, isn't it?
[03:05.86] It's really the worst
[03:07.19] It's hard
[03:08.22] Makes me wonder why I didn't think of that first
[03:11.58] It's hard
[03:12.08] Hard to alleviate the pressure to create
[03:15.06] It's hard
[03:16.23] Hard to do something as good as the last thing I did that was already great
[03:20.13] It's hard
[03:20.74] It's hard,
[03:21.47] So hard that he is stealing from the bard
[03:23.95] Well I'll hoist him by his petard
[03:26.19] All I need is a clever disguise
[03:28.28] Clever disguise
[03:28.83] I'll make him pay for those devious lies
[03:30.56] Devious lies
[03:31.00] Let him do all the tedious stuff
[03:32.97] The work that's terribly and unbearably hard
[03:37.68] Alright Nick Bottom
[03:39.11] I think Shakespeare needs to find out
[03:41.27] What Shakespeare's next big hit will be
[03:43.80] Cause it's hard
[03:45.15] It's totally hard
[03:45.94] It's hard
[03:46.85] It's totally hard
[03:48.37] It's hard
[03:49.37] It's totally hard
[03:50.44] I've got fortune and fame
[03:51.57] Everyone knows my name
[03:52.37] I can't help it if it's so freakin' hard
